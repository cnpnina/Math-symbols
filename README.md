# Math-symbols
**Convolution Neural Network Project to predict 11 classes of Math symbols**\
This project we create our own data set to implements a deep learning approach for recognizing handwritten mathematical symbols. It utilizes the pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor and trains a custom neural network classifier 11 classes to predict specific math symbols from images and we also train a custom classifier for accurate symbol recognition which is Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision trees to compare which algorithms perform the best on this task.

## Project Goals

- Develop a highly accurate deep learning model for recognizing handwritten math symbols.
- Leverage the power of VGG19 for efficient feature extraction.
- Train a custom CNN classifier specifically optimized for math symbols.
- Compare the performance of CNNs, SVMs, and decision trees for this task.

## Technologies Used

- Deep learning framework: TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- Pre-trained model: VGG19
- Data manipulation and visualization: NumPy and Matplotlib
