# Math-symbols
**Convolution Neural Network Project to predict 11 classes of Math symbols**\
This project we create our own data set to implements a deep learning approach for recognizing handwritten mathematical symbols. It utilizes the pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor and trains a custom neural network classifier 11 classes to predict specific math symbols from images.

Features:
- Leverages the power of VGG19 for efficient image feature extraction.
- Employs a custom neural network architecture optimized for classifying handwritten math symbols.
- Offers the potential for high accuracy in symbol recognition.
